# Hackster Learning Series: AI Agentic Protocols

This GitHub repo complements The Learning Series articles on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/) about **AI Agentic Protocols**. It covers:
- the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for dynamic tool and data access,
- the **Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)** for direct agent collaboration,
- and the **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** for robust, interoperable communication.

The repo includes Python code to jump-start practical implementation of these protocols, offering immediate application opportunities.
